# Breathe Ministries

<p class="h4 quote-lg alt-title">
"For we are Godâ€™s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago"
</p>

Ephesians 2:10 - NLT


Breathe exists to champion women from all walks of life.  We believe that every woman matters and has a unique contribution to make to this world. Inspired by our Christian faith, our core aim is to encourage, equip and empower women to be the very best they can be. We believe our united journey is even stronger since we are better together!

There are so many opportunities to connect with women of all ages at C3 and beyond, making new friends, and being encouraged and inspired in our faith.
