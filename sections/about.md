# Breathe Ministries

Welcome to a new style of Breathe invitation. This was such a fun day of styling and photography with
beautiful women and children who were happy to brave the elements in order to inspire you women to know how loved and blessed you are.

Women from all generations declaring that as we walk through this world we can hold our head high with beauty and grace since He has crowned us with so much dignity and blessing. Lifting off our shame and giving us a future and a hope.

Blessings for our enjoyment but not for our
indulgence. Blessings that are promised as we walk in obedience. Blessings for those that are prepared to count the cost for their faith.
Blessings so bountiful that others benefit from them. Creating a place on earth for Godâ€™s
kingdom to come and His will to be done.
Creating community where there was once loneliness. Joy where there was once mourning. Beauty instead of ashes.

As we gather this year I believe we will be brought to a fresh place of intimate
worship, hearing a beautiful whisper from heaven of everlasting love. We will listen
to inspiring stories of hope and learn about life
victories against all the odds. We are sure to have a few moments of laughter as well as a few tears as we realise again how we can trust and release our fears to a God that knows us so well.

Through it all we will be impacted by honest and
insightful biblical teaching by women who I just know you are going to love.

So whether you are new to Breathe
or a long term friend we are preparing
the party for you in mind.

Looking forward to seeing you soon
