          We are excited to announce our speaker Sophia Barrett for Breathe 19: Tell Your Story. Sophia is Senior Pastor of !Audacious Church in Manchester, with her husband of 20 years Glyn. Under their leadership, the church has grown to 3500 members across two locations. Sophia has an incredible life story which will encourage, inspire and bring release to all who hear it.

      Our second exciting announcement is that we have secured Rev Dr. Kate Coleman to be with us at Breathe Conference. Kate is the founding director of Next Leadership. She has over 30 years of leadership experience in the church, charity and voluntary sectors and is a mentor and coach to leaders. A popular speaker and lecturer, Kate has gained a reputation as a visionary and an inspiration to many. She is a strategic advisor who mentors, coaches and supports leaders and organisations locally, nationally and internationally.

      Joining Sophia and Kate, for all our Breathe Girls is Hannah Adkins, who has been a key member of the team at !Audacious Church since it started in 2007. Having spent years in youth ministry, Hannah will offer an unforgettable experience for our Breathe Girls, impacting them to live out their story with confidence and poise.
