        We are excited to announce our speaker Sophia Barrett for Breathe 19: Tell Your Story. Sophia is Senior Pastor of !Audacious Church in Manchester, with her husband of 20 years Glyn. Under their leadership the church has grown to 3500 members across two locations. Having been bought up in Australia, and moving to the UK with Glyn in 1996, Sophia has quite a story to tell, and from this story has written the book ‘Stay’ which has impacted many people in their personal story of faith.

        Joining Sophia, for all our Breathe Girls is Hannah Adkins, who has been a key member of the team at !Audacious Church since it started in 2007. Having spent years in youth ministry, Hannah will offer an unforgettable experience for our Breathe Girls, impacting them to live out their story with confidence and poise.
