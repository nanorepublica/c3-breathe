        I'm telling you now.<br/>
        You can be a creator, a lawyer, a doctor, a homemaker.<br/>
        You can a teacher, a preacher, an athlete, a scientist, a speaker,<br/>
        You can grow things or learn things or read things or write things.<br/>
        You drive places, walk places, swim places, hate open spaces.<br/>
        You can be wild and free, you can be calm and discreet you can be as mad as a hatter.<br/>
        But you matter.<br/>
        People really matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can learn to be bold to be courageous and strong.<br/>
        You can sing you can dance, you can walk arm in arm.<br/>
        You can love to be in the midst of a crowd.<br/>
        You sit in silence, finding the clock ticking loud.<br/>
        You can be in this country or that one or that one.<br/>
        You can be someone unknown or someone of stature.<br/>
        But you matter.<br/>
        People really matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The breath in your lungs is from the same place as mine,<br/>
        We cannot be compared we are not less than each other.<br/>
        We are the same but we are different, fantastic in equal measure.<br/>
        The intricacy of who you were created to be is an absolute work of art.<br/>
        This moment, this breath, this image is just the start.
      </p>

      <p >
        Whatever you're doing, whoever you are,<br/>
        Know that you matter.<br/>
        That people really matter.
      </p>
