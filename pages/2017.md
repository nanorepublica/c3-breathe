    <h2><span class="alt-title">Julie</span> Galanti</h2>

    <p>
    Julie lives a full life as a wife, mother, pastor, leader and friend. She looks after Sisterhood and Pastoral Care for Hillsong Church’s Central London location. The growth curve of the church to thousands of people is reflective of the growth curve of her internal life as she has remained planted in the local church, walking with Jesus. Other than her family, her passion is seeing people encounter God every Sunday, learning to walk a path of longevity and experiencing ever-increasing revelation. She also enjoys reading, adventure trips (once swimming on the back of a whale shark!) and entertaining (true to her Greek heritage, alarming guests with oversized food portions!)

    <p>
    Lydia Todd is encouraging, warm, gracious and full of positivity. Together, along with her husband Roy, they lead the Junction church in Loughborough and Leicester. Lydia was born near Leeds and studied theology at university. People love her brilliant way of inspiring them to face the challenges of everyday life with faith and hope. Lydia is down to earth and real. When she’s not doing church stuff, you’ll probably find her at the gym!

    <h1>Compassion</h1>

    <p>
    This year Breathe Conference is partnering with Compassion to help release children from poverty. We can do this in a very practical way by bringing knitted baby bonnets, muslins and 0-12 month age socks to be taken to Compassion projects in Kenya. The Compassion team will be joining us at the conference, along with a Compassion Graduate and the Any Girl Exhibition.
