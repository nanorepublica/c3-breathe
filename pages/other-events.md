# Breathe <span class="alt-title">Nights</span>

On Saturday 11 May we will be joined by Charlie Blyth from Hillsong London. Charlie is a pastor at Hillsong as well as a powerhouse speaker, she is also the European Director for The A21 Campaign, whose vision is to see human slavery abolished in the 21st century.

We have mocktails and cupcakes planned so you don't want to miss out on a great night with the girls!

Save the date - booking opens soon!
