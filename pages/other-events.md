# Breathe <span class="alt-title">Women</span>

Breathe women is a group for women of all ages!  We meet fortnightly for friendship, worship and the Word. There’s also a great programme for pre-school children. Come and be inspired as our guest speakers share some valuable lessons from their own walk with God.

We look forward to welcoming you!

* When: Thursday mornings
* Time: 10:30am – 12pm
* Frequency: Fortnightly
* Where: C3 CENTRE, Coldhams Lane, Cambridge

Breathe women restarts on Thursday 11th January for our Spring Term programme 'Breathe -Making room for Sabbath' bible study by Priscilla Shirer. Join us as we journey together over 6 sessions to discover how we can break free from our 'to-do lists' and overloaded lives into the true freedom of Sabbath and rest that is God's gift to us in Jesus.
