Saturday 14 September 2019, 9:00 - 12:30

Join us for a light breakfast as we set out to encourage, stretch and propel you to the next level of living and leading in professional space. We come together as women of different professional backgrounds to share with you something of our journey, how we overcame obstacles, seized opportunities and learned to lead out of who we are. We are: church leaders, international charity directors, executives of a multibillion company called Chick-fil-A, mums, daughters, sisters.
