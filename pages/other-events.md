<h1>Breathe <span class="alt-title">Banquet</span></h1>

We are delighted to be hosting our first Breathe Banquet, and you're invited! Come along for a delicious meal and hear from the inspirational Merrilyn Skinner from Watoto Child Care ministries. She'll be sharing about how as women we can increase our impact on our world.

Watoto Child Care Ministries currently cares for more than 3,000 children within three Watoto villages. Each child living in these villages is raised in a family setting rather than an institution. The Skinners’ vision is that the children be raised to become the future leaders of Uganda and Africa.

* Date: October 21th 
* Time: 7pm onwards
* Cost: £20
