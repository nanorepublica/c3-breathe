# Breathe Presents ... <span class="alt-title">an Evening with Margaret Stunt</span>

Breathe invites you to join us for an incredible evening with our close friend - Margaret Stunt. She is joining us all the way from Australia and is sure to bring a passionate and inspiring message for us all. The evening will be impacting, fun, and full of God moments.

We think that there is something powerful when women come together in support of each other, so during the evening we will be supporting our local Women's Aid charity. [Here](http://cambridgewa.org.uk/donationswanted.php) is a list of items they are in need of immediately and [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/127YPW67NQQFZ/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go_v?) is an Amazon Wish List of bigger items that are needed for their refuge houses. We will have a collection point on the night for anyone that wishes to donate. Please help us in supporting this amazing charity and the work that they do to help vulnerable women and children. Thank you.

Now Ladies, if you fancy coming away from the evening with more than the wonderful encouragement from Margaret, why not head home with some new clothes in hand, whilst being able to re-home that dress that's been sat at the back of the wardrobe?!  We will be operating a Clothes Swap after our evening with Margaret Stunt.

Bring your ‘nearly new' items along with you on the evening, hand them to one of our lovely hosts, and they will exchange your items for tokens which can then be redeemed in our Clothes Swap Lounge, after the event! What a better way to round off the evening with a bit of shopping! For those of you wishing to participate, but have not got any clothes to swap, do not worry! Items can be purchased on the night, with all proceeds going into our Vision Offering. Any items left at the end of the evening will be donated to Women's Aid. See you on the swap floor, girls!

* When: 12 May 2018, 6pm
* Where: C3 Centre, Coldhams Lane, Cambridge
