# Breathe <span class="alt-title">Banquet</span>

Breathe Ministries exists because we, as ladies, are surrounded by others who inspire us to become more than we are. The journey they face and the paths they have travelled, give us the courage and hope to pursue ‘the more’ for our own lives. That’s our main aim for Breathe Ministries - to inspire, champion and celebrate each other! We also believe that one of the best places to do this is over food!

This year’s Breathe Banquet is a unique event: I am especially excited about having our friend Abs Niblock, (Life Church, Leeds) inspiring us. Abs will be telling her own story of faith and resilience, being a woman in leadership, and a wife and mother of two miracle children, whilst also leading a relevant city centre church and an amazing cutting-edge youth ministry; Rock nations! Her story is inspiring and engaging, plus it offers us a wonderful opportunity to invite our friends who may not have attended Church before.

We wanted to create an environment of celebration and that’s why Breathe Ministries have developed the Pineapple Awards: to honour the women who are making their one life count.  I’m sure each of us can think of one person who deserves to be celebrated: that single mum, or teacher who always goes above and beyond, or a nurse who treated a family member with dignity.

We know there are many women who need us to stand with them, especially those who have no-one else, so Breathe has chosen Women’s Aid Cambridge as its charity this year. We asked Women’s Aid how we can bless their women this Christmas and they said “with gifts!” Now girls, that’s something we’re good at! They would love new items such as slippers, pyjamas/nightwear for women, gloves, purses, umbrellas, stationary sets, underwear/socks, and arts/crafts materials (i.e. adults colouring books/sewing kits). So, let's get shopping!

We cannot wait to see you there!

Best wishes,
