<h2><span class="alt-title">Rachel</span> Hickson</h2>

    <p>
    Rachel Hickson and Gordon have been married 36 years. They have two married children and five grandchildren. They both worked alongside Reinhard Bonnke in Africa from 1986 for 6 years. During this time, in Zimbabwe, Rachel almost lost her life in a horrific car accident, but was miraculously healed by God. In 1990 Rachel and her husband led a group of four churches in Hertfordshire and Heartcry for Change was born. Rachel and Gordon moved to Oxford in May 2005, where they still live today and where she has authored 8 books! 
    Rachel has a passion to see radical lovers of Jesus shift the atmospheres in our society today…and is crazy enough to believe an army of ordinary people like us CAN DO IT!

    <p>
    Helen Azer was born in England but grew up in Egypt where she lived for the first sixteen years of her life.

Helen is called especially to train and equip the Church and desires to enable Christians to become radical lovers of Jesus who are informed, articulate and confident communicators of their faith.
    Helen is the UK Director of Heartcry for Change and has been part of the itinerant ministry team for over ten years. Helen loves to read, travel and drink (good!) coffee while people watching! She is the co-author of Release My Frozen Assets: a look at the role of women in the church published by Heartcry for Change.

    This year Breathe Conference is partnering with Compassion to help release children from poverty. We can do this in a very practical way by bringing knitted baby bonnets, muslins and 0-12 month age socks to be taken to Compassion projects in Kenya. The Compassion team will be joining us at the conference, along with a Compassion Graduate and the Any Girl Exhibition.
