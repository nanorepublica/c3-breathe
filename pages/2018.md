       DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHINE, LET NO-ONE DULL YOUR SPARKLE

      <p>
      Every single one of us brings a unique gift and influence into our worlds. Every precious feminine heart has a story that has worth and value in the God story of all time.
      </p>

      <p>
      As our story unfolds we may begin to wonder at the grace and intrigue which calls us to Himself over and over, to hear the God whisper in our lives. It’s time for us to gather and hear His heart for us once more.
      </p>

      <p>
      For we each have a part to play.<br>
      We each have an influence to nurture.<br>
      We are called to be light bearers, colour creators, season shakers, culture masters, peace makers, love wearers and true worshippers. <br>
      WE ARE CALLED TO LEAD<br>
      </p>

      <p>
      To lead with dignity and strength, with our eyes focussed, our hearts lightened and our hope secure.
      </p>

      <p>
      We are calling all the brave, those not so brave and the down-right fearful
      to come and position yourselves to be challenged, inspired, loved on, nurtured and commissioned for the future God has for each one of us.
      </p>

      <p>
      Love ya!

<h2><span class="alt-title">Rachel</span> Hickson</h2>

    <p>
    Rachel Hickson and Gordon have been married 36 years. They have two married children and five grandchildren. They both worked alongside Reinhard Bonnke in Africa from 1986 for 6 years. During this time, in Zimbabwe, Rachel almost lost her life in a horrific car accident, but was miraculously healed by God. In 1990 Rachel and her husband led a group of four churches in Hertfordshire and Heartcry for Change was born. Rachel and Gordon moved to Oxford in May 2005, where they still live today and where she has authored 8 books! 
    Rachel has a passion to see radical lovers of Jesus shift the atmospheres in our society today…and is crazy enough to believe an army of ordinary people like us CAN DO IT!

    Helen Azer was born in England but grew up in Egypt where she lived for the first sixteen years of her life. On a year abroad in Germany for her university degree, Helen felt God’s call to full-time Christian ministry. She trained at Wycliffe Hall theological college, Oxford, and was ordained in 2004.

          Many attendees find the opportunity for discussion with like-minded women helpful, experiencing a sense of community and positive, mutual change.
        <br>
          After launching Shine at C3 in 2010 we have seen over 350 women benefit from increasing their self-esteem but feel this is just the start.
        <br>
          The team now plan to take this to the wider community where so many more women will be impacted. To find out more check out the ‘Taste of Shine’ seminar at Breathe this year.
